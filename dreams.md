# Dreams

After being asked to describe my wildest dreams for this project, I was reminded that dreams that are not written down or otherwise recorded outside of the body are less likely to come to fruition. So, here I am listing some dreams for this project that I hope will inspire anyone with shared dreams to find a point of collaboration (especially queer tech and energy work nerds)! Since this a dream page, there is not currently clarity on how these objectives would be realistically funded and maintained.

### Progressive Web App
- database for divestment-oriented in-app meditations, energy work guides, and mindfulness-related art generated by collaborators
- story-telling database, including stories of success and challenges from participants (need to figure out licensing)
- project blog and rss feed to aggregate the work of other aligned writers, artists, etc 
- offline (no-log) quiz with light gamification to help newcomers identify the easiest starting points for their journey
- download of the self-audit tool pdf (or maybe an interactive version in the app with local and offline storage)
- link to the project's ideally self hosted socials and video content (e.g. mastodon or bluesky, flarum, peertube, open collective or liberapay, etc) 
- resource database for well-tested, well-maintained open source software and hardware that:
  - people can use to energetically resource themselves (e.g. Inner Breeze)
  - people might consider learning to use or switching to
- directory of aligned practitioners who can provide individualized sliding-scale consultations or support 

### Community self-hosting and community hardware network
- building and training a mutual aid group of tech-inclined volunteers to help community orgs and businesses properly maintain community-operated servers (or paid if sufficient funding)
- training non-profits, libraries, community-oriented businesses, and mutual aid groups to set up and properly maintain/secure ad-free servers for decentralized forums and social media accounts (e.g. mastodon, bluesky, discourse, jitsi or mirotalk, peertube, whisper, etc)
- train inclined entrepreneurs and solopreneurs in self-hosting and properly securing and physically protecting servers for their client data and offerings (or collaborating with the trained non-profits, mutual aid groups, etc instead)
- digital and tech literacy trainings co-facilitated with aligned organizations 

### Socials & body-doubling/coworking  
- mastodon or bluesky instances (for social media updates)
- jitsi or mirotalk instances (for body-doubling/coworking and live offerings/trainings)
- peertube instance (for the project's video content)
- moderated flarum or gnu mailing list (for support and connection)
- gitlab, codeberg or gitea repo where inclined folks can contribute (for project contribution/collaboration)

### Published digital and printable Zines
- stories and art for the movement emphasizing the importance of decentralized community self-archiving and history-recording 

### Financial networks 
- Open Collective 
- liberapay
