# Praxis: Methods

## Methods: description
More Coming Soon
- Methods are specific actions taken to directly advance strategies that were identified as effective means of manifesting the principles we hold that are rooted in our values. 

## Methods 
- As a part of the [Digital Energy Work](praxis___digital-energy-work.md#digital-energy-work-1) project, a [[self-audit]] tool will be designed to help digital energy workers determine which methods they would like to tackle first. The audit will help self-assign [[d.e.w drops]] of energy, time, experience, and money to various actions as a way of visualizing priorities, managing capacity, and identifying areas of connection and opportunities for collaboration and help.
- The self audit will clarify which actions can be taken with relative ease and quickness, and which ones will require more planning, support and investment.
- In addition to the self-audit, a simple personalizable chart will be provided to help make choices easier from both a practical perspective and an emotional perspective. This will provide explicit connections between a strategy's methods and the principles and values an energy worker has associated with them, allowing each digital energy worker to weave their personal story into their digital abolitionism process.
- Creating interactive visual media to support this process will be an area for [collaboration](collaborators.md)! 
- Other intended D.E.W projects include a monthly (or weekly, if funding is received) body-doubling session in which people can come together to work on implementing their methods
- with long term funding, create a progressive web app that is designed to integrate energy work and self-inquiry with digital privacy, security and autonomy adoption

## Methodological considerations 
Without getting unnecessarily technical, there is value in applying some structure to developing right-for-you methods. One way of adding structure is by identifying the areas of tension between your principles and your capacity for action or change, and labeling problematic programs, apps, etc that have valid reasons to create a sense of pause when searching for alternatives.
I call these Tension Apps: Tension is the name applied to the experience of navigating the push of proprietary programs and the pull of Free and Open Source (FOSS) programs. Often the FOSS alternatives do not have the necessary features or ease for our particular use cases, weakening the pull of FOSS and strengthening the push of privacy- and autonomy-disrespecting programs.
A sustainable digital energy work praxis must acknowledge the intensity of this experience of tension and the threat it can pose to the wide-scale adoption of privacy-preserving options. The praxis must also provide a framework for choosing the least harmful proprietary options when FOSS alternatives do not exist.
Ideally, when identifying specific actionable changes (called "methods" here), the process of naming tension (categorizing accordingly) is important because it honors the nuances of our energetic realities, relationships and experiences instead of promoting an unatainable ideal that can drive people away from making changes.
