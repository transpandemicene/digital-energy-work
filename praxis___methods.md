# Praxis: Methods

## Methods: description
More Coming Soon
- Methods are specific actions taken to directly advance strategies that were identified as effective means of manifesting the principles we hold that are rooted in our values. 

## Methods 
- As a part of the Digital Energy Work project, a [[self-audit]] tool will be designed to help digital energy workers determine which methods they would like to tackle first. The audit will help assign [[d.e.w drops]] of energy, time, experience, and money to various actions as a way of visualizing priorities, managing capacity, and identifying areas of connection and opportunities for collaboration and help.
- The self audit will clarify which actions can be taken with relative ease and quickness, and which ones will require more planning, support and investment.
- In addition to the self-audit, a simple personalizable chart will be provided to help make choices easier from both a practical perspective and an emotional perspective. This will provide explicit connections between a strategy's methods and their associated principles and values, allowing each digital energy worker to weave their story into their digital abolitionism process.
- Creating interactive visual media to support this process will be an area for [collaboration](collaborators.md)!
