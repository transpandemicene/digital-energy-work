## What are Digital Energy Work and digital energy work?

### digital energy work?
- In the context of this site, when written in lower case, digital energy work refers to any energy work intentionally engaged in while becoming mindful of and making informed decisions about our relationship with our digital lives. Our digital lives can include our:

  - personal and professional computer, tablet and smartphone usage
  - presence on social media platforms
  - data storage, including file transfers, syncing and backups
  - online communications, including email, text messaging, instant messaging
  - computer-based gaming (on or offline)
  - accounts held with providers of various online and cloud services
  - anything we create digitally (e.g. music, art, photography, writing, etc)


#### But what is energy work!?
- Many definitions of both "energy" and "work" exist, and exploring them all is out of scope of this project. In this context,
- **energy** refers to:

  - our experiences and perceptions of the relationships and connections between our:
    - physical bodies (e.g. muscles, bones, brains, nervous systems, etc), and
    - subtle bodies (e.g. emotions, sensatons, identities, thoughts, beliefs, mentality, willpower, etc)
    - spirit/soul/consciousness/divine awareness (whatever one chooses to call it)

  - our experiences of the relationships between and our connections with our own energies and the energies of:
    - other people
    - non-human animals
    - Earth and Earth's elements
    - human-built physical environments
    - human-built digital environments
    - the cosmos
    - idealized realms that are beyond accurate human measurement (e.g. heaven, ancestral realms, paradise, etc)

  - **energy work** therefore refers to:
    - the general effort we make to become mindful of our own energy and the energies around us
    - the strategies and methods we employ to facilitate that mindfulness (e.g. prayer, observation and recording of habits & patterns, self-reflection, dreaming, cross-cultural communication, education without indoctrination, etc)
    - the practices we engage in to intentionally shift our energies and the energies around us (e.g meditation, one-pointed focus, breath work, sound healing, palm-healing and reiki, divination, dream interpretation, yoga asana, qi gong, tai chi, dance, affirmation, journaling, and other activities meant to connect us with what we perceive to be sacred)
  
### Digital Energy Work
- In the context of this site, when written in [title case](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/capitalization/title-case), Digital Energy Work speaks specifically to this project spearheaded by Zel Amanzi (they/he). 
- The Digital Energy Work project applies counter-colonial and abolitionist principles and values to the practice of any energy work designed to change our online habits and decision-making, specifically in service of resisting and rejecting overwhelming pressure to conform to the digital world envisioned by megacorporations like Meta (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Threads, etc), Apple, Microsoft, Google (Alphabet, Inc), and Amazon.
- The Digital Energy Work project has specific [values](praxis___values.md) and [principles](praxis___principles.md), and has no intention to appeal to or appease persons who resonate with conservative or moderate politics (in an occupied Turtle Island / United States context).
