## What are Digital Energy Work and digital energy work?

### digital energy work
- In the context of this site, when written in lower case, digital energy work refers to any energy work intentionally engaged in while becoming mindful of and making informed decisions about our relationship with our digital lives. Our digital lives can include our:

  - personal and professional computer, tablet and smartphone usage
  - presence on social media platforms
  - data storage, including file transfers, syncing and backups
  - online communications, including email, text messaging, instant messaging
  - computer-based gaming (on or offline)
  - accounts held with providers of various online and cloud services
  - anything we create digitally (e.g. music, art, photography, writing, etc)


#### But what is energy work!?
- Many definitions of both "energy" and "work" exist, and exploring them all is out of scope of this project. The approach to energy work within this project is heavily influenced by [animist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animism) spiritualities.

Here are some contextualized definitons:
#### Energy  
- our experiences of and perceptions of the relationships and connections between our:
    - physical bodies (e.g. muscles, bones, brains, nervous systems, etc), and
    - subtle bodies (e.g. emotions, sensatons, identities, thoughts, beliefs, mentality, willpower, etc)
    - spirit / soul / consciousness / divine awareness (however one names it)

- our experiences of the relationships between and our connections with our own energies and the energies of:
    - other people
    - non-human animals
    - Earth and Earth's elements
    - human-built physical environments
    - human-built digital environments
    - the cosmos
    - idealized realms that are beyond accurate human measurement (e.g. heaven, ancestral realms, paradise, etc)

#### **energy work** 
- the general effort we make to become mindful of our own energy and the energies around us
- the strategies and methods we employ to facilitate that mindfulness (e.g. prayer, observation and recording of habits & patterns, self-reflection, intentional dreaming, cross-cultural communication, self- and community- education, etc)
- the practices we engage in to intentionally shift our energies and the energies around us (e.g meditation, ritual, one-pointed focus, breath work, sound healing, herbalism, palm-healing and reiki, divination, dream interpretation, yoga asana, qi gong, tai chi, dance, affirmation, journaling, and other activities meant to connect us with what we perceive to be sacred)
  
#### Digital Energy Work
- In the context of this site, when written in [title case](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/capitalization/title-case), Digital Energy Work (D.E.W) speaks specifically to this project spearheaded by Zel Amanzi (they/he). 
- The Digital Energy Work project applies counter-colonial and abolitionist principles and values to the practice of any energy work designed to change our online habits and decision-making, specifically in service of resisting and rejecting overwhelming pressure to conform to the digital world envisioned by megacorporations like Meta (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Threads, etc), Apple, Microsoft, Google (Alphabet, Inc), and Amazon.
- The Digital Energy Work project has specific [values](praxis___values.md) and [principles](praxis___principles.md), and has no intention to appeal to or appease persons who resonate with conservative or moderate politics (in an occupied Turtle Island / United States context).
  
## So, what is a Digital Energy Work [praxis](praxis.md)?
Unlike many privacy, security and other digital literacy initiatives (many of which I'm very grateful for!), Digital Energy Work centers the role that our subtle bodies play in the way we make decisions about our digital lives. While the project does intend to provide a certain amount of technical education to help budding digital energy workers understand the value of applying important changes to their digital lives, **the heart of D.E.W really rests in helping people align their abolitionist values with their digital practices and presences.** 

Digital Energy Work particularly recognizes how spiritually and energetically taxing it is to decide to divest from imperialist companies who invest heavily in making their users believe that their products are benign and that our data is safe with them. We are regularly bombarded with information that consistently proves these megacompanies are lying, but there are so many psychological, emotional and social barriers that prevent us from shifting to digital worlds that reflect our values _even when the financial and material barriers to change are removed_! 

Changing one's mindset around the tools of social connection and personal development that many of us have used for years (and become actually addicted to) can spark **fear, confusion, insecurity, defensiveness, shame, guilt, exhaustion** and other strong emotions that can activate trauma responses. It's therefore essential that we engage in these processes in ways that also activate our **joy, connection, inspiration, excitement, creativity, curiosity, care, confidence, affection and cultural wisdom**.  

**The D.E.W praxis therefore revolves around **
- providing supportive [energy work](#energy-work) to navigate the big feels
- self-inquiry and discernment to:
  - make values-aligned action feel personal
  - to develop priorities, areas of strength and areas of increased support
  - to gain clarity around what is and what is not possible for your own digital life without getting stuck in comparisons of what others are / are not doing
- collaboraton, coworking and body-doubling so none of us feel alone in the process
- community care and movement building because that's the entire point
- story-telling and history sharing because Y'ALL!! the history of digital liberation movements is older than the internet and is actually RADICAL AF and very inspiring, and we cannot let the lessons of our predecessors fall by the wayside
- creating opportunities for anolog and in-person connection and archiving
  
**and centers**
- Developing a personal Alignment Model 
  - inspired by threat modeling, but with an equal emphasis on what we are creating for ourselves in addition to what we are protecting ourselves from
  - allows for every person to take a sustainable approach that matches the privileges and limitations of their own circumstances
- Divesting from Meta, Google (Alphabet), Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and other popular privacy-violating software like Spotify (I know...) to the highest extent possible for any given person or group according to their alignment model
- Investing in and migrating to privacy-respecting free, libre and open source software (FLOSS) wherevere possible, especially when they are:
  - ad-free and telemetry-free
  - offline-first
  - set up for p2p and/or e2ee syncing 
  - well-maintained and regularly updated
  - built or maintained by marginalized developers
- Developing best practices around software, hardware and online identities 
- Understanding popular terms and software types, their limitations, and their appropriate contexts so that we don't fall prey to coercive marketing, e.g. 
  - end-to-end encryption, password managers, vpns, anti-virus software, etc
  - differentiating between privacy, security, anonymity and pseudonimity 
- Identifying and implementing harm-reduction plans for using proprietary and addictive software, including 
  - Use Without Choice (UWoC) Software
    - privacy-violating software we are forced to use for work
    - privacy-invasive apps that dominate the field to such an extent that choosing a FLOSS alternative reduces the quality of experience below what is acceptable for the use case (e.g. google maps, uber)
  - Tension Apps
    - proprietary apps that create tension for any reason when trying to switch away from them (e.g. being unable to close a facebook account because it's the only way to contact uncle fred or the best way to find an affordable local sofa)
  - Near-Aligned Proprietary Apps 
    - proprietary apps that:
      - enable significant, but not total alignment with abolitionist digital praxis (e.g. open-code/source-available, e2ee cloud, no telemetry, no registration or login, offline or local-first, open and portable file format, ad-free)
      - position digital energy workers to begin migrating away from imperial apps
      - significantly limit the degree to which one engages with or strenghtens imperial apps
      - examples include library apps like Freegal Music or Libby, or writing apps like Obsidian
- Connecting people to resources on and establishing support for breaking cycles of digital addiction

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Because of its focus on abolitionism, and its consequent rejection of the racist, classist, sexist, and ableist ideologies of capitalism, imperialism and colonialism, Digital Energy Work will not appeal to _many_ FOSS and digital privacy and security enthusiasts!
