# Praxis: Principles

## Principles: A Background
I'm often asked, **"what's the point of this? Google already has all my data!"** I understand why people ask this: Google has an unethical amount of information about me and all my peers, some of which I probably can't do anything about. Yet, I de-google anyway as a strategy in service of my principles.

When I speak of principles, it's often misintperpreted as antagonistic. I don't practice digital energy work in service of a digital abolitionist journey because I hate google, apple, meta, amazon, or microsoft. They are all pioneers in their own ways.

I practice abolitionist digital energy work because doing so is in alignment with my own principles...because as long as I am alive, I have the capacity to align my actions with my values. So, even if a lot of my data is a lost cause, my integrity is not.

When I get overwhelmed by the magnitude of effort involved in resistance, I return to my principles as a way to remember that I always have some measure of autonomy even when evil conglomerates do their damnedest to deprive me of it. Because my principles are ultimately what makes me who I am. 

Those who know me from my spiritual work know that I center [counter-colonial purpose](https://www.transgressivemedicine.co/courses.html#heart-healing) in all i teach because it is a powerful centering tool in a world that profits from pulling us away from ourselves in service of...well, someone else's profits. Counter-colonial purpose is about centering who we feel called *to be* in any given moment and letting that drive our actions, big and small. It's not about career or otherwise deriving self-concept from what we *do*. In that veins, given that I spend most of my life in front of a screen generating digital data, I'd like my digital life to be as much a manifestation of my principles as possible.

## Example Principles
Here are some principles I've been sitting with on my own journey; they'll probably evolve as I do.

- i center violently-targeted communities and reject our abuse and exploitation
  
- i prioritize collaboration and cross-community communication, relying on decentralized community webs to initiate empowering actions
  
- i apply small solutions to big problems as a ongoing practice in empowerment, creativity and autonomy
  
- i seek power within, not power over (except in cases of self-defense, where I seek equity)

- i seek pathways to resistance as a process of building integrity and dignity in the present moment, rather than as a way to achieve a future goal

- i establish myself in offline networks and online networks, so as to always remain empowered and connected when disconnected from the internet

- i celebrate zero stakes competition where the point of participation and the prize for winning are the same: to enjoy life and relationship
	
- when outmatched by an immense antagonistic force:

	- i ask what i *can* do along with neutrally acknowledging what i cannot do
	- i ask what i cannot do only as a method of conserving life force and illuminating available alternative paths
