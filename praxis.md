# Praxis â¤µ

At it's simplest, a praxis is a **marriage of theory and practice:** 
> [!NOTE]  
> in a counter-colonial context, **practice without theory** is often misguided, ineffective, and violent, while **theory without practice** is often hollow, out-of-touch, and supremacist

<br></br>
## Loose Definitions
To help me gain clarity, I came up with simple definitions *for myself*. They are deliberately oversimplified! This simplicity helps me when I am struggling to understand what kind of decision i want to make when i encounter tension in my privacy journey; others may see things differently or choose words like *ethics* or *morals*.

> [!IMPORTANT]  What's in a Praxis?
> * **Values**: what i believe is true, right, and good; what drives my principles
> * **Principles**: how i want to behave to align with my values
> * **Strategies**: the pathway that allows me to firmly choose my principles by connecting the dots between methods and values
> * **Methods**: specific actions that initialize and sustain my strategies and manifest my principles

## Generating clarity â¤µ
Without clarity around my praxis, I became too easy to believe what any privacy, security, degoogling (etc) influencer suggested, which led to me trying out things that I later ended up feeling were a waste of my time (even if they were useful to somebody else's journey).

> [!TIP]  
> I found it easier to figure out my own praxis after differentiating between: [principles](praxis___principles.md), [values](praxis___values), [strategies](praxis___strategies.md), and [methods](praxis___methods.md).

<br></br>
* I decided to differentiate between principles, values, strategy and method because I noticed my peers conflating them in a way that made it harder for us to communicate about the value of embarking on a digital privacy journey, especially when they became overwhelmed by the sensation that tackling a digital privacy journey felt like a full lifestyle change.
* For example, my radical friends could talk for days about imperialism and abolitionism, but would freeze up at the suggestion of choosing an email provider other than gmail. They'd get frustrated with me when I started to ask for alternatives to their google forms, and insinuated that I was doing the most when I didn't want them recording notes from our conversations in google docs. Things weren't adding up.
* Over time, our conversations revealed that many of them thought that degoogling was a *principle* of mine, when in fact is a strategy that affirms my (and *our*) principles and guides some of the methods I use to align my actions with my values.** 
* For clarity, I had to learn to express that I am not against Google. Google has added undeniable value to our lives. I *am* against exploitation, monopolies, manipulation, coercion, dishonesty, and unchecked power. And well, Google engages in all of those things on a massive scale (sources upcoming).
* These, I realized, were *anti-values*: things I believe are sufficiently harmful that I work to keep them out of my life as much as possible. 
* So then, I had to ask myself: what are my values? And what...are my principles? And how do they differ? And how do I communicate that to people i love without sounding like a pompous nerd?
* I haven't figured out the pompous nerd part ðŸ¤ª, but gaining clarity on [[#Loose Definitions]] has helped my friends and I shift from tense misunderstanding to generative collaboration.

### So, what is a [digital energy work praxis](praxis___digital-energy-work)?
