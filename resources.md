# Resources & Connections
Digital energy work, like any other energy work, requires an openness to ideas that feel unfamiliar and to people who move through this world in unconventional ways. Because our existing algorithms and search results are not designed to amplify the voices of marginalized people or to show us what we have not already demonstrated an interest in, it can be difficult to find information about various digital energy work processes that feel welcoming, inclusive, aligned and exciting.

These resources sections aim to provide coonnections to information, people, ideas and organizations that can make people forced to live on the margins of society feel less alone and more motivated in our digital energy work practices.

## Categories
- [Books](resources___books.md)
- [People](resources___individuals.md)
- [Online Media](resources___online-media-etc.md)
- [Organizations](resources___organizations.md)
- [Sites & Directories](resources___sites-directories.md)

## Contributions
> [!NOTE]  
> I haven't established an official contribution method or set of guidelines yet, but it is in the works! 

This repo will eventually move to gitlab or codeberg to maintain an aligned [praxis](praxis.md). However, for now, if you are:
1. familiar with github and have an account 
2. have valuable resources you'd like to share
3. understand common pull request etiquette 

then, please feel free to submit a pull request to add links to any of the resource category pages. Beginner-friendly contirbution methods will be established as soon as possible.
- Resources created by multiply-marginalized people and resources that are rooted in counter-colonial & anti-oppression work will be prioritized. 
- To recommend a new resource category or to mark an already-listed resource as out of alignment with the [principles](praxis___principles.md) of this project, open an issue instead.
