## what is digital energy work? 
- digital energy work, a project rooted in [digital-abolitionist](#) [praxis](praxis.md); it is an extension of [transpandemicene](#).
- it includes some lofty objectives that boil down to: â¤µ
	- **building community around shared abolitionist values and principles** for people who intuitively understand the destructive impact that digital imperialism will continue to have on the social fabric of violently targeted communities (e.g. disabled people, queer and trans people, racialized people, genocide survivors & refugees, etc)
	
	- **sharing strategies** for mutual aid, community care, and archival practices **that empower us in the face of digital predation**, while honoring how spiritually taxing it is to resist and connect during an era of open fascism and unacknowledged pandemics.

	- **creating interactive learning spaces** that enable violently targeted communities to more safely navigate our digital lives in an era that both actively criminalizes our survival and exploitatively surveils our digital relationships.
	
	- providing **guides & tips on adopting methods** that make it easier for our communities to begin and/or sustain their own digital privacy & autonomy journeys.
