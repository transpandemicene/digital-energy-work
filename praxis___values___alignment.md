# Praxis: Values Alignment

It can be overwhelming to sit with the ways in which our digital lives have subtly and overtly pulled many of us way out of alignment with our values. We often know that we don't want to show up online in the ways that we are doing so, but we genuinely don't know how to show up differently. 

When we don't have clarity around our values, attempting to make changes to our digital lives can become emotionally, mentally and spiritually paralyzing. Digital Energy Work consequently centers [values alignment](praxis___values___alignment.md) as the foundational energy work practice of this project.

> Values Alignment is the process of deliberately aligning our methods, strategies and principles with our values.

Values alignment allows each individual energy worker to start sifting through the noise and start confidently making decisions about their online life, whether or not their choices are popular in their existing social circles.

## Example Alignment 
when i'm faced with a complex problem that i am inclined to give up on, and i'm looking for a way to through that honors my integrity
- **values**: empowerment, autonomy, self-determination, individuality, creativity
- **principle**: i solve problems (even when "the point" is elusive) as an ongoing practice in creativity, empowerment and self-determination
- **strategy**: when my window of tolerance is closing, look for the helpers
- **methods**: create and publish a centralized repository of people and projects that are working toward similar goals so that I and others can find the helpers
