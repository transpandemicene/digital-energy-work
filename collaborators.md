# Collaborations

One of the most important parts of any habit-altering journey is storytelling! We will all inevitably run into road bumps and eventually get confused and overwhelmed. Sometimes, we start to think that we are just not cut out for all this newness. In those moments, what most of us really need is a story of how someone we relate to responded to the same feelings. 

As Digital Energy Work evolves, storytelling will become an important avenue of collaboration. As collaborators in the project are confirmed, their names will be added below. When their contributions are ready to share, a link to their contribution will be included with their name!

Because this project is rooted in an abolitionist praxis and seeks to build community for multiply-marginalized digital energy workers, all collaborators will have at least one of the following identities that significantly impacts their daily life under fascism:
1. People of the Global Majority / Racialized
2. Queer, Trans and/or Non-Binary
3. Disabled and/or Chronically Ill
4. Neurodivergent / Neuroqueer
