# Praxis: Values

## What are values?

In the context of [Digital Energy Work](praxis___digital-energy-work.md), values are the foundation of a digital energy work practice. Values, in the simplest possible definition, are that which we believe to be right, true, desirable and good. 

Any [principles](praxis___principles.md), [strategies](praxis___strategies.md), and [methods](praxis___methods.md) we clarify as digital energy workers ultimately point back to our values. Our values are the reference points that allow us to determine what aligned action looks like for us and creates space for us to empathetically understand that individuals with different values will consequently approach digital energy work praxis differently.

Centering values allows for any group of digital energy workers to come together in ways that both honor diversity and create shared practice. It also supports discernment, as many people who care about digital privacy, security and autonomy will make general statements about what is "best" without acknowledging that "best practices" are rarely generic and usually vary depending on particular [threat models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threat_model) that may or may not be relevant to our own situation.

Centering values allows Digital Energy Workers to acknowledge our [social locations](https://www.badoulatrainings.org/blog/the-importance-of-knowing-and-naming-your-social-location) in ways that help clarify why we may adopt, reject or modify strategies and methods differently than our friends, families and colleagues. It allows us to set boundaries and understand why the same digital choices may feel liberating for some and dangerous to others. Holding these nuances can save a lot of miscommunication between and within groups of people who might be playing around with similar strategies and methods for entirely different reasons (and for whom the consequences of the same choices may vary dramatically).

Most importantly, centering values allows us to recognize when and why a strategy or method doesn't create the impact in our lives that we desire. It helps us navigate those tricky moments where we are obligated or feel strongly compelled to participate digitally in ways that don't feel good. It helps us ground when we are presented with overwhelming choice and don't know how to move forward. It saves us time by helping us prioritize and giving us confidence to say yes or no, not because others are doing so, but because we know what is right for us.

## Values Alignment 
It can be overwhelming to sit with the ways in which our digital lives have subtly and overtly pulled many of us way out of alignment with our values. We often know that we don't want to show up online in the ways that we are doing so, but we genuinely don't know how to show up differently. 

When we don't have clarity around our values, attempting to make changes to our digital lives can become emotionally, mentally and spiritually paralyzing. Digital Energy Work consequently centers [values alignment](praxis___values___alignment.md) as the foundational energy work practice of this project.

> Values Alignment is the process of deliberately aligning our methods, strategies and principles with our values.

Values alignment allows each individual energy worker to start sifting through the noise and start confidently making decisions about their online life, whether or not their choices are popular in their existing social circles.

 ## Example Values: Digital Energy Work Project
 > [!NOTE]  
 > This is a first draft


 - all digital consumers deserve to build a meaningful, supportive and connected digital life in ways that do not violate their dignity, integrity, privacy or security. therefore, we value:
   - building digital lives whose foundations receive at least the same level of care, attention, intention and standards as our in-person relationships and analog products
   - prioritizing software that allows users signifant participation in the means of production
   - developing software that meets needs identified by communities without gatekeeping access to the solutions 
   - treating digital literacy as equally important as classical literacy (e.g. reading & writing) in a world where nearly all social and financial connection is digitally mediated
   - popular digital education that empowers multiply-marginalized communities to sustain connection, heal divisions and resource themselves without sacrificing their liberties and dignities
 - disenfranchised, violently-targeted, and impoverished communities deserve community self-determination and autonomy and have the right to resist and escape their oppression. therefore, we value:
   - software and hardware that does not rely on exploitative data gathering or create vendor lock-in 
   - open-source, source-available, and open-code softwares that create choice
   - developing software that can run on any hardware
   - creating frameworks that allow communities to judge their capacity for divestment themselves without judgment from individuals or groups who carry more privilege
 - we value informed consent and the right of all digital consumers to understand the consequences of their digital actions and to reject software that violates their values without losing access to critical digital infrastructure. Therefore, we also value:
   - short and plain language privacy and security policies that are never so long or complex that they essentially deprive people of the possibiity of informed consent
   - policies that do not coerce users into nonconsensually violating their own values in order to use a digital product that is necessary to sustain their professional or social relationships
 - digital economies should free us from the tyranny of oppressive material economies, not replicate them. therefore we value:
   - equitable exchange so that aligned developers and creators are well-compensated for their contributions while software remains financially accessible to impoverished people
