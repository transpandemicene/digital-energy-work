 ## Example Values 
 > [!NOTE]  
 > This is a first draft


 - all digital consumers deserve to build a meaningful, supportive and connected digital life in ways that do not violate their dignity, integrity, privacy or security. therefore, we value:
   - building digital lives whose foundations receive at least the same level of care, attention, intention and standards as our in-person relationships and analog products
   - prioritizing software that allows users signifant participation in the means of production
   - developing software that meets needs identified by communities without gatekeeping access to the solutions 
   - treating digital literacy as equally important as classical literacy (e.g. reading & writing) in a world where nearly all social and financial connection is digitally mediated
   - popular digital education that empowers multiply-marginalized communities to sustain connection, heal divisions and resource themselves without sacrificing their liberties and dignities
 - disenfranchised, violently-targeted, and impoverished communities deserve community self-determination and autonomy and have the right to resist and escape their oppression. therefore, we value:
   - software and hardware that does not rely on exploitative data gathering or create vendor lock-in 
   - open-source, source-available, and open-code softwares that create choice
   - developing software that can run on any hardware
   - creating frameworks that allow communities to judge their capacity for divestment themselves without judgment from individuals or groups who carry more privilege
 - we value informed consent and the right of all digital consumers to understand the consequences of their digital actions and to reject software that violates their values without losing access to critical digital infrastructure. Therefore, we also value:
   - short and plain language privacy and security policies that are never so long or complex that they essentially deprive people of the possibiity of informed consent
   - policies that do not coerce users into nonconsensually violating their own values in order to use a digital product that is necessary to sustain their professional or social relationships
 - digital economies should free us from the tyranny of oppressive material economies, not replicate them. therefore we value:
   - equitable exchange so that aligned developers and creators are well-compensated for their contributions while software remains financially accessible to impoverished people
