# Praxis: Strategies

## What are Digital Energy Work Strategies?
In the context of Digital Energy Work [praxis](praxis.md), **strategies** are the pathways that allows us to firmly choose our principles by connecting the dots between methods and values. Strategies can vary in structure, but typically can serve as an umbrella category for a set of methods, or specific actions we can take. 

We all have developed strategies, consciously or not, that help us navigate decision-making in our day to day. Sometimes our strategies become so well worn that we lose the ability to name them. Part of Digital Energy Work is bringing those subconscious strategies to the surface and recognizing whether they are aligned to values that move us forward in our purposes or values that hold us back in self-protection. We all need to protect ourselves to some degree, but we often do so far beyond that necessary degree. In doing so, we might strengthen strategies for immediate survival that become at odds with our ability to thrive long term.

When we [align](praxis___values___alignment.md) our strategies for digital liberation and autonomy with our principles and values, we become empowered to manage overwhelm, honor our capacity, create priorities, identify peers to work closely with, and determine the right methods for ourselves even if those are not the same as what is currently popular.
